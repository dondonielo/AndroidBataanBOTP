			can remove enemies by jumping over an occupied point into an empty point as in checkers and multiple jumps are allowed. 
			The blue armies can only be removed if they refuse a jump.The blue and yellow piece armies can both move one step 
			in all directions provided there is an empty destination cell.

            <h2>Game Victory</h2>
            <p text-align="justify">Victory occurs when either the Japanese Field Army occupies all 17 American Flag in the Defense Area(Japanese wins) 
			or when it becomes impossible for them to do so (the Defense army kills more than 33 Japanese men, American wins). 
			The game will also end if there are no Americans left (if it is all removed) and the Japanese wins. 
			Also, a draw occurs when all of the remaining American Defense Army are surrounded by the Japanese Field Army 
			and it cannot make any move provided that the Japanese Field Army has not occuppied the defense area.
